Extended Property *depends_on* References
=========================================

In Traits 3.0, the **Property** *depends_on* metadata has been extended to
take advantage of the new extended trait name support offered by the
*on_trait_change* method.

Previously, the *depends_on* metadata for a *Property* was restricted to
referencing traits defined either on the same object as the **Property**, or
on an object immediately reachable from the object. For example::

    class Wheel(Part):

        axel     = Instance(Axel)
        position = Property(depends_on = 'axel.position')

        ...

Starting with Traits 3.0, the *depends_on* metadata may now include any
extended trait reference that is allowed by the enhanced *on_trait_change*
method. So, for example it is now legal to write things like::

    class Wheel(Part):

        axel     = Instance(Axel)
        position = Property(depends_on = 'axel.chassis.position')

or::

    class Child(Person):

        mother = Instance(Person)
        father = Instance(Person)
        mood   = Property(depends_on = ['mother.+mood_affecting',
                                        'father.+mood_affecting'])

In particular, in the last example we are declaring that the **Child** class's
*mood* property depends upon the values of any of either its mother or
father object's traits that have *mood_affecting* metadata defined.

Thus, a **Child** object's *mood* property will fire a trait change
notification whenever any of the its mother's or father's mood affecting
traits change.

Refer also to the code tabs for this lesson for a complete example using a
**Property** definition using *depends_on* metadata containing an extended
trait reference. In particular, take a look at the **LeagueModelView Class**
tab's *total_hits* trait definition.
