# --(on_trait_change Decorator)------------------------------------------------

on_trait_change Decorator
=========================

Until Traits 3.0, the only way to define a static trait notification handler
as part of a class definition was to define the method following a certain
naming convention::

    def _name_changed(self, ...):
        ...

    or

    def _name_fired(self, ...):
        ...

where *name* is the name of the trait to which the notification handler method
applies.

Starting with Traits 3.0, there is now an alternate method for declaring
notification handlers using the **on_trait_change** decorator. The syntax
for the decorator is::

    @on_trait_change('extended_trait_name')
    def any_method_name(self, ...):
        ...

where *extended_trait_name* is the name of the trait for which the following
method is the notification handler, and *any_method_name* is an arbitrary
method name, which does not need to follow any particular naming convention.

Although the new syntax is more verbose than the original syntax, it has
several advantages:

- It does not require using special method names.
- It allows using the extended trait naming support added to the
  **on_trait_change** method in Traits 3.0.

The last item is especially important since it allows you to statically
declare notification handlers for many more cases than were previously
possible.

For example::

    @on_trait_change('foo,bar,baz')
    def _update(self):
        ...perform update logic...

defines an *_update* method that is called whenever the class's *foo*, *bar*
or *baz* traits change. Previously, this would have required writing three
separate notification handlers (one each for the *foo*, *bar* and *baz*
traits), or adding *event* metadata to each of the trait declarations for
*foo*, *bar* and *baz*.

Similarly, the previous technique of writing methods such as::

    def _bar_changed_for_foo(self, ...):
        ...

which statically defines a notification handler for changes to the *bar* trait
of the object's *foo* trait can now be written as::

    @on_trait_change('foo.bar')
    def any_method_name(self, ...):
        ...

Perhaps even more importantly, this technique can be applied in even more
complex situations, such as::

    @on_trait_change('foo.bar.baz')
    def any_method_name(self, ...):
        ...

    or

    @on_trait_change('foo.+dirty,foo2.[bar,baz,foogle]')
    def any_method_name(self, ...):
        ...

The first case is a simple extension of the previous example, while the
second is a somewhat far-fetched example which can be interpreted as
defining a method that handles:

- Changes to any trait on the object's *foo* trait which has *dirty* metadata
  defined, or
- Changes to the *bar*, *baz* or *foogle* trait of the object's *foo2* trait.

Note that there is one important semantic difference between writing::

    def _name_changed(self, ...):
        ...

and::

    @on_trait_change('name')
    def any_method_name(self, ...):
        ...

While both are recognized as being notification handlers for the object's
*name* trait, the interpretation of the argument signature for the first case
follows the static trait change handler pattern, while the second case follows
the dynamic **on_trait_change** method pattern. While this might seem obvious,
given the fact that the decorator is called *on_trait_change*, it is an
important enough difference to note explicitly.

A Complete Example
------------------

Refer to the code tabs of this lesson for a complete example using the
*on_trait_change* decorator. In particular, look at the definition of the
*sick_again* method in the **Corporation Class** tab.
