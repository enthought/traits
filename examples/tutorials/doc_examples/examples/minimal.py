# --[Imports]------------------------------------------------------------------
from traits.api import HasTraits, Float, TraitError


# --[Code]---------------------------------------------------------------------
class Person(HasTraits):
    weight = Float(150.0)


# --[Example*]-----------------------------------------------------------------
# instantiate the class
joe = Person()

# Show the default value
print(joe.weight)

# Assign new values
joe.weight = 161.9  # OK to assign a float
print(joe.weight)

joe.weight = 162  # OK to assign an int
print(joe.weight)

# The following line causes a traceback:
try:
    joe.weight = "average"  # Error to assign a string
    print("You should not see this message.")
except TraitError:
    print("You can't assign a string to the 'weight' trait.")
