"""
This example shows how to set up notifications for a trait that is defined
after the instance is created.

The optional flag suppresses the error that would otherwise occur because the
trait is not found at the time ``observe`` is called. When the observed trait
is defined, the change handler will be aded to the new trait.

from traits.api import HasTraits, Int, observe
from traits.observation.api import trait

class Person(HasTraits):

    @observe(trait("age", optional=True))
    def notify_age_change(self, event):
        print("age changed")

person = Person()
person.add_trait("age", Int())
person.age = 2    # print 'age changed'
