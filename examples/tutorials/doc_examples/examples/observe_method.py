"""
This example shows how to set up notifications for changes on a single trait,
for a specific instance of HasTraits.

The change handler can be removed using the 'remove' argument on ``observe``.
"""

from traits.api import HasTraits, Int, observe

class Person(HasTraits):
    age = Int(0)

def print_change(event):
    print("{} changed: {} -> {}".format(event.name, event.old, event.new))

person = Person(age=1)
person.observe(print_change, "age")
person.age = 2    # print 'age changed: 1 -> 2'

person.observe(print_change, "age", remove=True)
person.age = 3    # nothing is printed.
