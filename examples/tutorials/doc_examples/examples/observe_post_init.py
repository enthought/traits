"""
This example shows how to set up notifications for changes on a single trait,
for all instances of this class, but only after the object state is set during
instantiation.

The 'post_init' argument suppresses change notifications during instantiation,
but allows subsequent changes to trigger notifications.

from traits.api import HasTraits, Int, observe

class Person(HasTraits):
    age = Int(0)

    @observe("age", post_init=True)
    def notify_age_change(self, event):
        print("age changed from {} to {}".format(event.old, event.new))

person = Person(age=1)  # no output
person.age = 2    # print 'age changed from 1 to 2'
