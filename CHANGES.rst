Release 6.0.0rc0
----------------

Released: 2020-01-30

Release notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traits 6.0 is a major update to the Traits package, with a number of
backward incompatible changes from its predecessor. Notable changes:

* Python 2.7 is no longer supported; Traits 6.0 requires Python 3.5 or later.
* Trait types related to Python 2 (for example ``Unicode`` and ``Long``) have
  been deprecated in favour of their Python 3 equivalents (for example ``Str``
  and ``Int``).
* Many little-used historical features of Traits have been deprecated, and
  are scheduled for removal in Traits 7.0.
* Some historical features of Traits that had no evidence of external usage
  were removed in Traits 6.0.
* Introspection of ``CTrait`` and ``HasTraits`` objects is greatly improved.
  All of the internal state that was previously hidden within the C extension
  is now accessible from Python.
* The Traits codebase has undergone some significant reorganizations,
  reformattings and style cleanups to make it easier to work with, and
  to improve the separation between Traits and TraitsUI.
* This release was focused mainly on cleanup and bugfixing. Nevertheless,
  it contains a sprinkling of new features. There's a new ``Datetime``
  trait type. The ``Enum`` trait type now supports Python enumerations.
  The ``File`` trait type supports path-like objects.

More than 150 PRs went into this release. The following people contributed
code changes for this release:

Porting guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the most part, existing code that works with Traits 5.2.0 should
continue to work with Traits 6.0.0 without changes. However, there
are some potentially breaking changes in Traits 6.0.0, and we recommend
applying caution when upgrading.

Here's a guide to dealing with some of the potentially breaking changes.

* The ``Unicode`` and ``CUnicode`` trait types are now simply synonyms for
  ``Str`` and ``CStr``. ``Unicode`` and ``CUnicode`` are considered deprecated.
  For now, no deprecation warning is issued on use of these deprecated trait
  types, but in Traits 6.1.0 and later, warnings may be issued, and in Traits
  7.0.0 these trait types may be removed. It's recommended that users update
  all uses of ``Unicode`` to ``Str`` and ``CUnicode`` to ``CStr`` to avoid
  warnings or errors in the future.

* Similarly, ``Long`` and ``CLong`` are now synonyms for ``Int`` and ``CInt``.
  The same recommendations apply as for the ``Unicode`` / ``Str`` trait types.

* Uses of ``NO_COMPARE``, ``OBJECT_IDENTITY_COMPARE`` and ``RICH_COMPARE``
  should be replaced with the appropriate ``ComparisonMode`` enumeration
  members.

* The validation for a ``Instance(ISomeInterface)`` trait type has changed,
  where ``ISomeInterface`` is a subclass of ``Interface``. Previously, an
  assignment to such a trait validated the type of the assigned value against
  the interface, method by method. Now an ``isinstance`` check is performed
  against the interface instead. Make sure that classes implementing a given
  interface have the appropriate ``provides`` decorator.

  One notable side-effect of the above change is that plain ``mock.Mock``
  instances can no longer be assigned to ``Instance(ISomeInterface)`` traits.
  To get around this, use ``spec=ISomeInterface`` when creating your mock
  object.

  This change does not affect ``Instance`` traits for non-interface classes.

* The format of ``TraitListEvents`` has changed: for list events generated from
  a slice set or slice delete operation where that slice had a step other
  than ``1``, the ``added`` and ``removed`` fields of the event had an extra
  level of list wrapping (for example, ``added`` might be ``[[1, 2, 3]]``
  instead of ``[1, 2, 3]``). In Traits 6.0, this extra wrapping has been
  removed. There may be existing code that special-cased the extra wrapping.

* Many classes and functions have moved around within the Traits codebase.
  If you have code that imports directly from Traits modules and subpackages
  instead of from ``traits.api`` or the other subpackage ``api`` modules, some
  of those imports may fail. To avoid potential for ``ImportError``s, you
  should import from ``traits.api`` whenever possible. If you find yourself
  needing some piece of Traits functionality that isn't exposed in
  ``traits.api``, and you think it should be, please open an issue on the
  Traits bug tracker.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Add new ``Datetime`` trait type. (#737, #814, #813, #815, #848)
* Support Python Enums as value sets for the ``Enum`` trait. (#685, #828, #855)
* Add ``Subclass`` alias for the ``Type`` trait type. (#739)
* Add path-like support for the ``File`` trait. (#736)
* Add new ``ComparisonMode`` enumeration type to replace the old
  ``NO_COMPARE``, ``OBJECT_IDENTITY_COMPARE`` and ``RICH_COMPARE``
  constants. The old constants are deprecated. (#830, #719, #680)
* Add fast validation for ``Callable`` trait type; introduce
  new ``BaseCallable`` trait type for subclassing purposes.
  (#798, #795, #767)
* Add ``CTrait.comparison_mode`` property to allow inspection and
  modification of a trait's comparison mode. (#758, #735)
* Add ``as_ctrait`` converter function to ``traits.api``. This function
  converts a trait-like object or type to a ``CTrait``, raising ``TypeError``
  for objects that can't be interpreted as a ``CTrait``. It's intended
  for use by users who want to create their own parameterised trait
  types.

  The ``as_ctrait`` feature comes with, and relies upon, a new informal
  interface: objects that can be converted to something of type ``CTrait`` can
  provide an zero-argument ``as_ctrait`` method that returns a new ``CTrait``.
  Types can provide an ``instantiate_and_get_ctrait`` method, which when
  called with no arguments provides a new ``CTrait`` for that type.
  (#783, #794)
* Add a new ``HasTraits._class_traits`` method for introspection of an
  object's class traits. This parallels the existing
  ``HasTraits._instance_traits`` method. This method is intended for use in
  debugging. It's not recommended for users to modify the returned dictionary.
  (#702)
* Add ``CTrait.set_default_value`` method for setting information about the
  default of a ``CTrait``. This provides an alternative to the previous method
  of using ``CTrait.default_value``. The use of ``CTrait.default_value`` to set
  (rather than get) default information is deprecated. (#620)
* Add new methods ``HasTraits._trait_notifications_enabled``,
  ``HasTraits._trait_notifications_vetoed`` to allow introspection of the
  notifications states set by the existing methods
  ``HasTraits._trait_change_notify`` and ``HasTraits._trait_veto_notify``.
  (#704)
* Add ``TraitKind``, ``ValidateTrait`` and ``DefaultValue`` Python enumeration
  types to replace previous uses of magic integers within the Traits codebase.
  (#680, #857)
* The various ``CTrait`` internal flags are now exposed to Python as
  properties: ``CTrait.is_property`` (read-only), ``CTrait.modify_delegate``,
  ``CTrait.setattr_original_value``, ``CTrait.post_setattr_original_value``,
  ``CTrait.is_mapped``, and ``CTrait.comparison_mode``. (#666, #693)

Changes
~~~~~~~

* When pickling a ``CTrait``, the ``py_post_setattr`` and ``py_validate``
  fields are pickled directly. Previously, callables for those fields were
  replaced with a ``-1`` sentinel on pickling. (#780)
* A ``TraitListEvent`` is no longer emitted for a slice deletion which
  doesn't change the contents of the list. (For example, `del obj.mylist[2:]`
  on a list that only has 2 elements.) (#740)
* The ``added`` and ``removed`` attributes on a ``TraitListEvent`` are now
  always lists containing the added or removed elements. Previously, those
  lists were nested inside another list in some cases. (#771)
* Change ``Instance(ISomeInterface)`` to use an ``isinstance`` check on
  trait set instead of using the dynamic interface checker. (#630)
* Create an new ``AbstractViewElement`` abstract base class, and register
  the TraitsUI ``ViewElement`` as implementing it. This paves the way for
  removal of Traits UI imports from Traits. (#617)
* ``ViewElements`` are now computed lazily, instead of at ``HasTraits``
  subclass creation time. This removes a ``traitsui`` import from
  the ``trait.has_traits`` module. (#614)
* The ``traits.util.clean_filename`` utility now uses a different algorithm,
  and should do a better job with accented and Unicode text. (#589)
* Floating-point and integer checks are now more consistent between classes.
  In particular, ``BaseInt`` validation now matches ``Int`` validation, and
  ``Range`` type checks now match those used in ``Int`` and ``Float``. (#588)
* An exception other than ``TraitError`` raised during validation of a
  compound trait will now be propagated. Previously, that exception would
  be swallowed. (#581)
* Traits no longer has a runtime dependency on the ``six`` package. (#638)
* Use pickle protocol 3 instead of pickle protocol 1 when writing pickled
  object state to a file in ``configure_traits``. (#796)
* In ``traits.testing.optional_dependencies``, make sure ``traitsui.api`` is
  available whenever ``traitsui`` is. (#616)
* ``TraitInstance`` now inherits directly from ``TraitHandler`` instead of
  (the now removed) ``ThisClass``. (#761)

Fixes
~~~~~

* Fix a use of the unsupported ``ValidateTrait.int_range``. (#805)
* Remove unnecessary ``copy`` method override from ``TraitSetObject``. (#759)
* Fix ``TraitListObject.clear`` to issue the appropriate items event. (#732)
* Fix confusing error message when ``[None]`` passed into
  ``List(This(allow_none=False))``. (#734)
* Fix name-mangling of double-underscore private methods in classes whose
  name begins with an underscore. (#724)
* Fix ``bytes_editor`` and ``password_editor`` bugs, and add tests for
  all editor factories. (#660)
* Fix coercion fast validation type to do an exact type check instead of
  an instance check. This ensures that instances of subclasses of the
  target type are properly converted to the target type. For example,
  if ``True`` is assigned to a trait of type ``CInt``, the resulting
  value is now ``1``. Previously, it was ``True``. (#647)
* Fix ``BaseRange`` to accept the same values as ``Range``. (#583)
* Fix integer ``Range`` to accept integer-like objects. (#582)
* Fix floating-point ``Range`` to accept float-like values. (#579)
* Fix a missing import in the adaptation benchmark script. (#575)
* Fix issues with the ``filename`` argument to ``configure_traits``. (#572)
* Fix a possible segfault from careless field re-assignments in
  ``ctraits.c``. (#844)

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``NO_COMPARE``, ``OBJECT_IDENTITY_COMPARE`` and ``RICH_COMPARE``
  constants are deprecated. Use the corresponding members of the
  ``ComparisonMode`` enumeration instead. (#719)
* The ``Unicode``, ``CUnicode``, ``BaseUnicode`` and ``BaseCUnicode`` trait
  types are deprecated. Use ``Str``, ``CStr``, ``BaseStr`` and ``BaseCStr``
  instead. (#648)
* The ``Long``, ``CLong``, ``BaseLong`` and ``BaseCLong`` trait types are
  deprecated. Use ``Int``, ``CInt``, ``BaseInt`` and ``BaseCInt`` instead.
  (#645, #573)
* The ``AdaptedTo`` trait type is deprecated. Use ``Supports`` instead. (#760)
* The following trait type aliases are deprecated. See the documentation for
  recommended replacments. ``false``, ``true``, ``undefined``, ``ListInt``,
  ``ListFloat``, ``ListStr``, ``ListUnicode``, ``ListComplex``, ``ListBool``,
  ``ListFunction``, ``ListMethod``, ``ListThis``, ``DictStrAny``,
  ``DictStrStr``, ``DictStrInt``, ``DictStrFloat``, ``DictStrBool``,
  ``DictStrList``. (#627)
* Use of the ``filename`` argument to ``configure_traits`` (for storing
  state to or restoring state from pickle files) is deprecated. (#792)
* The ``TraitTuple``, ``TraitList`` and ``TraitDict`` trait handlers
  are deprecated. Use the ``Tuple``, ``List`` and ``Dict`` trait types instead.
  (#770)
* Use of ``CTrait.default_value`` for setting default value information is
  deprecated. Use ``CTrait.set_default_value`` instead. (#620)
* Use of the ``rich_compare`` trait metadata is deprecated. Use the
  ``comparison_mode`` metadata instead. (#598)

* The codebase is now mostly ``flake8`` clean. (#786, #753, #747, #748, #746,
  #595)
* Copyright headers have been made consistent for all Python files. (#754)
* ``ctraits.c`` has been run through ``clang-tidy`` and ``clang-format`` in
  order to bring it closer to PEP 7 style. (#715)
* Editor factories have been moved into a new ``traits.editor_factories``
  module, to help compartmentalize code dependencies on TraitsUI. (#661)
* Trait container object classes (``TraitDictObject``, ``TraitListObject``,
  ``TraitSetObject``) have each been moved into their own module, along
  with their associated event type. (#677)
* Miscellaneous other minor fixes, refactorings and cleanups.

bugfixes and small improvements to the code.

Highlights of this release include:

* support for Python 3.4 and 3.5.
* new Bytes and ValidatedTuple traits.
* a new ArrayOrNone trait which correctly handles None comparisons with Numpy
  arrays.
* clean-up of the ETSConfig code for TraitsUI toolkit selection.
* better compatibility with NumPy scalar types.
* many other bugfixes and improvements.

Change summary since 4.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancements

* Added a ``Bytes`` Trait and related traits (#329)
* Added support for finding resources from zipped Python source code (#316)
* Added in-place set arithmetic operations for ``TraitSetObject``s and accept
  match behaviour of ``TraitSetObject`` with regular Python sets when
  performing operations with non-set types (eg. lists, dictionaries) (#289)
* Added a context manager to allow provisional selection of a toolkit to
  ``ETSConfig`` (this generally improves reliability of toolkit selection
  for Pyface and TraitsUI). (#276)
* Added Trait change recorder to aid in debugging event-driven code. (#139)
* ``__iadd__`` and ``__imul__`` implemented on TraitListObjects. (#165)
* Added new ``ArrayOrNone`` trait type to replace the
  ``Either(None, Array)`` idiom.  The old idiom results in warnings
  on NumPy >= 1.9. (#219)
* Added a new ``ValidatedTuple`` trait that supports custom validation. (#205)

Changes

* Removed redundant, internal ``ETSConfig`` from Traits codebase. (#327)
* Better error reporting for failed attribute access. (#243)
* Removed buggy ``-toolkit`` commandline option ``ETSConfig``. (#326)
* Removed buggy ``*names`` positional arguments from ``on_trait_change``
  decorator in improved argument passing (#207).
* Allow ``Float`` and ``BaseFloat`` traits to accept Python longs. (#272)
* Clean-up and fixes to example code. (#126)
* Remove outdated ``ImportSpy`` and ``ImportManager`` utilities. (#188)
* The ``deprecated`` decorator now issues a DeprecationWarning (using
  the Python ``warnings`` module) rather than logging a warning via
  the ``logging`` machinery.  It no longer tries to remember when
  a warning has been previously issued. (#220)
* Deprecated ``HasTraits.get()`` and ``HasTraits.set()`` (#190).
* The default ``View`` shows all (non-event) traits whose ``visible`` property
  is not ``False``. Private traits are set ``visible=False`` by default. (#234)

Fixes

* Fix Bool traits so that value stored is always a Python ``bool`` (and in
  particular, not a NumPy ``np.bool_``). (#318)
* Fix Bool traits so that regular validator accepts NumpPy's ``np.bool_``
  boolean values (bringing it in agreement with the fast validator). (#302)
* Fix use of ``next`` in ``TraitDocumenter`` for Python 3 compatibility. (#293)
* Fix off-by-one error when ``TraitListObject`` is setting or deleting slices.
  (#283)
* Fix reference cycles caused by ``sync_traits``. (#135)
* Fix so that ``sys.exc_info()`` works as expected in exception handlers in
  Python 3 (#266)
* Fix ``String`` trait to accept ``str`` subclasses (like ``numpy.str_``).
  (#267)
* Fixed incorrect in list events for ``insert`` operations with an index
  outside the range [``-len(target_list)``, ``len(target_list)``]. (#165)
* Fix incorrect behaviour of ``check_implements`` for overridden methods.
  (#192)
* Fix error when trying to listen to traits using list bracket notation. (#195)
* Fix reference leak in ``CHasTraits._notifiers``. (#248)
* Fix reference leak from use of ``DelegatesTo``. (#260)
* Instance traits weren't included in the result of ``traits()``. (#234)

Release 4.4.0
-------------

The major new feature in this release is a new adaptation mechanism in the
``traits.adaptation`` package.  The new mechanism is intended to replace the
older traits.protocols package.  Code written against ``traits.protocols`` will
continue to work, although the ``traits.protocols`` API has been deprecated,
and a warning will be logged on first use of ``traits.protocols``.  See the
'Advanced Topics' section of the user manual for more details.

The release also includes improved support for using Cython with ``HasTraits``
classes, some new helper utilities for writing unit tests for Traits events,
and a variety of bug fixes, stability enhancements, and internal code
improvements.


Change summary since 4.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features

* The adaptation mechanism in Traits, formerly based on the 'traits.protocols'
  package, has been replaced with the more robust 'traits.adaptation'
  package. (#51)
* Added utility function for importing symbols (name, classes, functions)
  by name: 'traits.util.api.import_symbol'. (#51)
* Users can set a global tracer, which receives all traits change events:
  ``traits.trait_notifiers.set_change_event_tracers``. (#79)

Enhancements

* Update benchmark script. (#54)
* traits.util.deprecated: use module logger instead of root logger. (#59)
* Provide an informative message in AdaptationError. (#62)
* Allow HasTraits classes to be cythonized. (#73)
* Improve tests for cythonization support. (#75)
* Extending various trait testing helpers (#53)

Refactoring

* The Traits notification code has been reworked to remove code duplication,
  and test coverage of that code has been significantly improved. (#79)

Fixes

* Fix race condition when removing a traits listener. (#57)
* Fix ugly interaction between DelegatesTo change handlers, dynamic change
  handlers and two levels of dynamic intialization. (#63)

Released: 2010-05-26

Enhancements

* adding new example to make testing rgb color editor easier

Fixes

  differed from its base class, but the calling code expected them to all
  be the same
* fixed bug which was related to type name errors caused when running Sphinx
* when using File(exists=True), be sure to validate the type of the value
  first before using os.path.isfile()


Release 3.3.0
-------------

Released: 2010-02-24

Enhancements

The major enhancement this release is that the entire Traits package has been
changed to use relative imports so that it can be installed as a sub-package
inside another larger library or package.  This was not previously possible,
since the various modules inside Traits would import each other directly
through "traits.[module]".  Many thanks to Darren Dale for the
patch.

Fixes

There have been numerous minor bugfixes since the last release.  The most notable
ones are:

* Many fixes involve making Traits UI more robust if wxPython is not installed
  on a system.  In the past, we have been able to use Qt if it was also
  installed, but removing Wx would lead to a variety of little bugs in various
  places.  We've squashed a number of these.  We've also added better checks
  to make sure we're selecting the right toolkit at import and at runtime.
* A nasty cyclic reference was discovered and eliminated in DelegatesTo traits.
* The Undefined and Uninitialized Traits were made into true singletons.
* Much of the inconsistent formatting across the entire Traits source has
  been eliminated and normalized (tabs/spaces, line endings).


Release 3.2.0
-------------

Released: 2009-07-15

Enhancements

* Implemented editable_labels attribute in the TabularEditor for enabling editing of the labels (i.e. the first column)
* Saving/restoring window positions works with multiple displays of different sizes
* New ProgressEditor
