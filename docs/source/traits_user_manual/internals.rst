Traits internals
================

This section of the documentation is intended both for those developing Traits
itself, and for those using Traits who would like a better understanding of
the Traits internals.


Fundamentals
------------

The runtime behavior of Traits is governed by two key classes: |CTrait| and
|HasTraits|. Each of these classes inherits from a superclass implemented in
the |ctraits| C extension module: |CTrait| inherits from |cTrait|, while
|HasTraits| inherits from |CHasTraits|.

The |CHasTraits| and |cTrait| base classes are not intended for direct use and
do not provide a complete, coherent API: that API is provided by their
respective subclasses |HasTraits| and |CTrait|. The existence and precise
semantics of the base classes should be regarded as implementation details.
In what follows, we'll frequently refer to behavior of |HasTraits| and |CTrait|
even when the behavior we're referring to is actually implemented by
|CHasTraits| or |cTrait|.

We'll examine both of these classes, along with some of their hidden state, in
more detail below.


Key class: |HasTraits|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary purpose of the |HasTraits| class is to override Python's normal
rules for attribute access. It does this by overriding the
``__getattribute__``, ``__setattr__`` and ``__delattr__`` special methods. At C
level, this is done through providing ``tp_getattro`` and ``tp_setattro``
"slots" to the |CHasTraits| ``PyTypeObject``: ``tp_getattro`` controls
attribute retrieval operations, while ``tp_setattro`` is called for both
attribute set and attribute deletion operations.

To support trait get and set operations, a |HasTraits| object (that is, in
normal use, an instance of a user-defined subclass of |HasTraits|) has two key
pieces of state: a dictionary of **class traits**, and a second dictionary of
**instance traits**. Each dictionary is a mapping from trait attribute names to
|CTrait| objects. A |CTrait| object encapsulates the rules for getting and
setting the corresponding attribute, as well as providing an attachment point
for trait notifications.

In addition to these two dictionaries, a |HasTraits| object has a ``__dict__``
that stores attribute values for that object in the normal way.

Analogously to class variables and instance variables in a normal Python class,
the class traits dictionary for a given |HasTraits| subclass is shared between
instances of that class, while the instance traits dictionary is specific to a
particular |HasTraits| instance. (As an internal optimization, the instance
traits dictionary is created on demand when first needed, while the class
traits dictionary is always present for each instance.)

For introspection and debugging purposes, both of these dictionaries can
be retrieved directly, using the |_instance_traits| and |_class_traits|
methods. However, it's not recommended to use either of these methods in
production code, and you should be especially careful when modifying either
of these dictionaries.

For example, consider the following |HasTraits| subclass::

    from traits.api import Float, HasTraits, Str

    class Ingredient(HasTraits):
        """ An ingredient in a recipe listing. """

        #: The name of the ingredient.
        name = Str()

        #: Ingredient quantity.
        quantity = Float()

Here's what happens when we create an instance of this ingredient and inspect
the instance and class trait dictionaries::

    >>> eggs = Ingredient(name="eggs", quantity=12)
    >>> eggs._instance_traits()
    {}
    >>> eggs._class_traits()
    {
        'name': <traits.ctrait.CTrait object at 0x1020cd400>,
        'quantity': <traits.ctrait.CTrait object at 0x1020cd360>,
        'trait_added': <traits.ctrait.CTrait object at 0x1020cd4a0>,
        'trait_modified': <traits.ctrait.CTrait object at 0x1020079a0>,
    }
    >>> eggs.__dict__
    {'name': 'eggs', 'quantity': 12.0}

Note that the actual values for the ingredient are stored in the ``__dict__``
as usual, not in the ``CTrait`` objects.

If we create a second ingredient, it shares class traits (but not
instance traits) with the first one::

    >>> flour = Ingredient(name="flour", quantity=3.5)
    >>> flour._class_traits() is eggs._class_traits()
    True
    >>> flour._instance_traits() is eggs._instance_traits()
    False


Key class: |CTrait|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A |CTrait| object has two main purposes:

- It encapsulates the rules for getting and setting a traited attribute on
  a |HasTraits| object.
- It provides an attachment point for trait notifiers.

The hidden state for a |CTrait| instance is encapsulated in the
``trait_object`` C ``struct`` in the |ctraits| source. There are several
interesting fields, not all of which are exposed at Python level.

Of particular interest are the ``getattr`` and ``setattr`` fields, which
hold pointers to C functions that act as the entry points for attribute
access via the given trait. See below for a fuller description of attribute
access mechanics.


Attribute retrieval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When evaluating ``obj.name`` for a ``HasTraits`` object ``obj``, the following
sequence of steps occurs (see ``has_traits_getattro`` in the C source):

- The ``name`` is looked up in ``obj.__dict__``. If found, the corresponding
  value is returned immediately.
- If ``name`` is not found in ``obj.__dict__``, we look first for an instance
  trait named ``name``, and then for a class trait named ``name``. Thus an
  instance trait with a given name will shadow a class trait with the same
  name.
- If a matching trait is found, its ``getattr`` field is invoked to retrieve
  the trait's value for the given object.
- If no matching trait is found, we try to access the attribute value
  using Python's usual attribute rules (via the ``PyObject_GenericGetAttr``
  C-API call).
- Finally, if the ``PyObject_GenericGetAttr`` call fails, we invoke the
  **prefix trait** machinery to get a new ``CTrait`` object, and use that
  new trait to get a value.

Note that the above sequence of steps applies to method access as well as
attribute access. Note also that there's no mechanism to automatically
search for ``CTrait`` objects in superclasses of the immediate ``HasTraits``
subclass.


Attribute set operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rules for setting an attribute (evaluating ``obj.name = value`` for a
``HasTraits`` object ``obj``) are analogous to those for attribute retrieval.
The starting point is ``has_traits_setattro`` in the source.

- First we look for the name ``name`` in ``obj._instance_traits()``,
  and retrieve the corresponding ``CTrait`` instance if present.
- If no matching entry is found, we then look up ``name`` in
  ``obj._class_traits()``, and again retrieve the corresponding ``CTrait``.
- If still not found, we invoke the **prefix trait** machinery to get a new
  ``CTrait`` object. By default, this goes through the
  ``HasTraits.__prefix_trait__`` method (which is implemented in Python), and
  this may still fail with an exception.
- If one of the above steps succeeded, we now have a ``CTrait`` object, and
  its ``setattr`` function is invoked (passing along the trait object, ``obj``,
  ``name`` and ``value``) to perform the actual attribute set operation.


Attribute deletion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attribute deletion (``del obj.name``) goes through the same code path as
attribute set operations. Most ``CTrait`` types do not permit deletion.
