Traits CHANGELOG
================

Since 4.3.0:

* The adaptation mechanism in Traits, formerly based on the 'traits.protocols'
  package, has been replaced with the more robust 'traits.adaptation'
  package.
* Added utility function for importing symbols (name, classes, functions)
  by name: 'traits.util.api.import_symbol'.
* Users can set a global tracer, which receives all traits change events:
  `traits.trait_notifiers.set_change_event_tracers`
