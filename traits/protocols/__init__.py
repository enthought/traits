"""Trivial Interfaces and Adaptation from PyProtocols.

This package used to be a subset of the files from Phillip J. Eby's
PyProtocols package. The package has been substituted by `traits.adaptation` as
of Traits 4.4.0.

Currently, the package contains deprecated aliases for backward compatibility,
and will be removed in Traits 5.0 .
