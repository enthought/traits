    Parameters
    ----------
    from_ : type or interface
        What the adapter adapts *from*, or a list of such types or interfaces
        (the '_' suffix is used because 'from' is a Python keyword).
    to : type or interface
        What the adapter adapts *to*, or a list of such types or interfaces.
    factory : callable
        An (optional) factory for actually creating the adapters. This is
        any callable that takes a single argument which is the object to
        be adapted. The factory should return an adapter if it can
        perform the adaptation and **None** if it cannot.
    cached : bool
        Should the adapters be cached? If an adapter is cached, then the
        factory will produce at most one adapter per instance.
    when : str
        A Python expression that selects which instances of a particular type
        can be adapted by this factory. The expression is evaluated in a
        namespace that contains a single name *adaptee*, which is bound to the
        object to be adapted (e.g., 'adaptee.is_folder').

    Note
    ----
    The ``cached`` and ``when`` arguments are ignored if ``factory`` is
    specified.
