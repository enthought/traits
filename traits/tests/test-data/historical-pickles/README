This directory contains binary files *.pkl whose contents are pickled traits
and trait-related objects of various kinds, used for testing backward
compatibility Traits unpickling.

The pickle filenames are of the form:

    hitp-t5.2.0-p0-<description>.pkl

where the "t5.2.0" portion gives the version of Traits that was used to create
the pickle, and the "p0" portion describes the pickle protocol.

The "generate_pickles" script can be used to generate pickle files for
a new version of Traits.
