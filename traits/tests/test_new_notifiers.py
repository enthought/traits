""" Tests for dynamic notifiers with `dispatch='new'`.

Dynamic notifiers created with the `dispatch='new'` option dispatch event
notifications on a new thread. The class handling the dispatch,
`NewTraitChangeNotifyWrapper`, is a subclass of `TraitChangeNotifyWrapper`.
Most of the functionality of the class is thus already covered by the
`TestDynamicNotifiers` test case, and we only need to test that the
notification really occurs on a separate thread.
