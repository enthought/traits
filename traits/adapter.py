    In Traits, an *adapter* is a special type of class whose role is to
    transform some type of object which does not implement a specific interface,
    or set of interfaces, into one that does.

    This class is provided as a convenience. If you subclass this class, the
    only things you need to add to the subclass definition are:

        * An implements() function call declaring which interfaces the adapter
          class implements on behalf of the object is is adapting.
        * A declaration for the **adaptee** trait, usually as an Instance of
          a particular class.
        * The actual implementations of the interfaces declared in the
          implements() call. Usually the implementation code is written in
          terms of the **adaptee** trait.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_ : type or interface
        What the adapter adapts *from*, or a list of such types or interfaces
        (the '_' suffix is used because 'from' is a Python keyword).
    to : type or interface
        What the adapter adapts *to*, or a list of such types or interfaces.
    factory : callable
        An (optional) factory for actually creating the adapters. This is
        any callable that takes a single argument which is the object to
        be adapted. The factory should return an adapter if it can
        perform the adaptation and **None** if it cannot.
    cached : bool
        Should the adapters be cached? If an adapter is cached, then the
        factory will produce at most one adapter per instance.
    when : str
        A Python expression that selects which instances of a particular type
        can be adapted by this factory. The expression is evaluated in a
        namespace that contains a single name *adaptee*, which is bound to the
        object to be adapted (e.g., 'adaptee.is_folder').

    ----
