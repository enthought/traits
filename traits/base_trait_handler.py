"""
Defines the Abstract BaseTraitHandler class.

A trait handler mediates the assignment of values to object traits. It
verifies (via its validate() method) that a specified value is consistent
with the object trait, and generates a TraitError exception if it is not
consistent.

class BaseTraitHandler(object):
    """ The task of this class and its subclasses is to verify the correctness
    of values assigned to object trait attributes.

    This class is an alternative to trait validator functions. A trait handler
    has several advantages over a trait validator function, due to being an
    object:

        * Trait handlers have constructors and state. Therefore, you can use
          them to create *parametrized types*.
        * Trait handlers can have multiple methods, whereas validator functions
          can have only one callable interface. This feature allows more
          flexibility in their implementation, and allows them to handle a
          wider range of cases, such as interactions with other components.
