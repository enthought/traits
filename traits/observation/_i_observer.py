class IObserver(abc.ABC):
    """ Interface for all observers.

    Each instance of ``IObserver`` can be a node in the
    ``ObserverGraph``. These objects are considered
    low-level objects not to be instantiated directly by the
    user. In order to support equality and hashing on the
    ``ObserverGraph``, ``IObserver`` needs to be hashable
    and it needs to support comparison for equality.

    A subclass of ``IObserver`` is often context specific, e.g. for observing
    a trait on an HasTraits instance, for observing items in a list, etc.

    Given an ``ObserverGraph``, observers are visited from the root node
    to the leaf nodes. The first observer (root node) will be given the object
    the user wants to observe. It knows how to obtain observable(s) for
    attaching notifiers. It also knows what objects should be given to the
    downstream/children observers in the same graph.

    An observer defines the notifier that wraps the user change handler, should
    notification is enabled by the user. This allows the observer to define
    how the user should receive the change event, e.g. what type of event
    object should be created, and whether a given event should be silenced etc.

    An observer also defines a "maintainer" (which is also a notifier from the
    point of view of an observable), for maintaining downstream observers when
    a change happens for an observable. For example, an observerable may not
    have a defined value yet for the children observers to handle. When the
    value is defined, the observable is expected to notify the maintainer,
    which will pass the new value onto the children observers.

    An observer can also contribute more ``ObserverGraph`` via
    ``iter_extra_graphs`` if they require support from other observers.

        The notifiers are contributed by this observer's ``get_notifier``

        An observer may observe many items, e.g. multiple traits for a given
        instance of HasTraits, then the observer will yield many items here.

        An observer may also observe just one thing, e.g. a single trait, or an
        instance of TraitListObject, then the observer may yield just that.

        An observer may also find nothing to be observed and does not need to
        complain about that, and it will yield nothing here.

        Observers are allowed to raise here if it is appropriate to do so,
        e.g. to help catch usage errors.

        Parameters
        ----------
        object: object
            Object provided by the ``iter_objects`` methods from another
            observers or directly by the user.
            No guarantee can be made about the type of the object.
            Concrete implementations should do the sanity check where
            appropriate.

    def iter_objects(self, object):

        ObserverGraph.

        An observer may yield many items for the next observer, e.g. the
        observer is observing many traits on the given instance of HasTraits
        or the observer is observing items in a container. The observer can
        evaluate whether the value is appropriate to be passed on, or skip some
        if the observer is expected to do so.

        An observer may yield one item if that is what should be passed onto
        the next observer.

        An observer may find nothing to be passed onto the next observer, and
        has no need to complain about that. Then the observer may yield
        nothing.

        Observers are allowed to raise here if it is appropriate to do so,
        e.g. to help catch usage errors.
