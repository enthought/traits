""" Event object for representing mutations to a dict.
"""

# DictChangeEvent is exposed in the public API


class DictChangeEvent:
    """ Event object to represent mutations on a dict.

    Note that the API is different from the ``TraitDictEvent`` emitted via the
    "*name* _items" trait. In particular, the attribute ``changed`` is not
    defined here.

    Attributes
    ----------
    object : traits.trait_dict_object.TraitDict
        The dict being mutated.
    removed : dict
        Keys and values for removed or updated items.
        If keys are found in ``added`` as well, they refer to updated items
        and the values are old.
    added : dict
        Keys and values for added or updated items.
        If keys are found in ``removed`` as well, they refer to updated items
        and the values are new.
