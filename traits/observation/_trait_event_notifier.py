class TraitEventNotifier:
    """ Wrapper for invoking user's handler for a trait change event.

    An instance of ``TraitEventNotifier`` is a callable to be contributed
    to an instance of ``IObserverable``, e.g. ``CTrait``, ``TraitList`` etc.,
    such that it will be called when an observerable emits notificaitons for
    changes. The call signature is defined by the observable object
    and may vary. It is the responsibility of the ``event_factory`` to adapt
    the varying call signatures and create an event object to be given
    to the user's handler.

    A ``TraitEventNotifier`` keeps a reference count in order to address
    situations where a same object is repeated inside a container
    and one would not want to fire the same change handler multiple times
    (see enthought/traits#237). For that purpose, a notifier keeps track of
    the ``HasTraits`` instance (called ``target``) on which the user applies
    the observers, keeps a reference count internally, and it also needs to
    determine whether another notifier refers to the same change handler and
    ``HasTraits`` instance.

    Since there is only one reference count associated with a notifier,
    each notifier is expected to be added to only one observable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    handler : callable(event)
        The user's handler to receive the change event.
        The event object is returned by the ``event_factory``.
        If the handler is an instance method, then a weak reference is
        created for the method. If the instance is garbage collected,
        the notifier will be muted.
    target : object
        An object for defining the context of the notifier.
        A weak reference is created for the target.
        If the target is garbage collected, the notifier will be muted.
        This target is typically an instance of ``HasTraits`` and will be
        seen by the user as the "owner" of the change handler.
        This is also used for distinguishing one notifier from another
        notifier wrapping the same handler.
    event_factory : callable(*args, **kwargs) -> object
        A factory function for creating the event object to be sent to
        the handler. The call signature must be compatible with the
        call signature expected by the observable this notifier is used
        with. e.g. for CTrait, the call signature will be
        ``(object, name, old, new)``.
    prevent_event : callable(event) -> boolean
        A callable for controlling whether the user handler should be
        invoked. It receives the event created by the event factory and
        returns true if the event should be prevented, false if the event
        should be fired.
    dispatcher : callable(handler, event)
        A callable for dispatching the handler, e.g. on a different
        thread or on a GUI event loop. ``event`` is the object
        created by the event factory.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the handler given is not a callable.
