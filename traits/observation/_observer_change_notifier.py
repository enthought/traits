class ObserverChangeNotifier:
    """ Wrapper for maintaining notifiers in an ObserverGraph
    when an upstream object changes.

    An instance of ``ObserverChangeNotifier`` is a callable to be contributed
    to an instance of ``IObserverable``, e.g. ``CTrait``, ``TraitList`` etc.,
    such that it will be called when an observerable emits notificaitons for
    changes.

    For example, suppose changes are observed on an extended attribute path,
    e.g. ``foo.bar.baz``, where ``foo`` and ``bar`` are both instances of
    ``HasTraits``.  There will be an instance of ``ObserverChangeNotifier`` on
    the ``CTrait`` for ``foo``. When ``foo`` changes, the notifier will be
    called for maintaining the observers for ``bar.baz``. Similarly, there
    will be an instance of ``ObserverChangeNotifier`` on the ``CTrait`` for
    ``bar`` for maintaining the observers for ``baz``, when ``bar`` changes.

        """

        Parameters
        ----------
        observer_handler : callable(event, graph, handler, target, dispatcher)
            The handler for maintaining observers and notifiers.
            ``event`` is the object created by the ``event_factory`` and is
            associated with the change event that triggers this notifier.
            The rest of the arguments are provided by the arguments to this
            notifier.
        event_factory : callable(*args, **kwargs) -> object
            A factory function for creating the event object to be sent to
            the observer_handler. The call signature must be compatible with
            the call signature expected by the observable this notifier is
            used with. e.g. for CTrait, the call signature will be
            ``(object, name, old, new)``.
        prevent_event : callable(event) -> boolean
            A callable for controlling whether the observer_handler should be
            invoked. It receives the event created by the event factory and
            returns true if the event should be prevented, false if the event
            should be fired.
        graph : ObserverGraph
            An object describing what traits are being observed on an instance
            of ``HasTraits``, e.g. observe mutations on a list referenced by
            a specific named trait.
        handler : callable(event)
            The user handler being maintained when a container object changes.
            A weak reference is created for the handler if it is an instance
            method. If the instance method handler is garbage collected, this
            notifier will be silenced.
        target : object
            An object for defining the context of the user's handler notifier.
            A weak reference is created for the target. If the target is
            garbage collected, this notifier will be silenced.
            This is typically an instance of HasTraits acting as a container
            for an observable on which this notifier is attached to. It would
            be seen by the user as the "owner" of the observer.
        dispatcher : callable(function, event)
            Callable for dispatching the user's handler.
